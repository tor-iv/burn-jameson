public/images/
  ✅ logo.png                      (Already have)
  ✅ verify.png                    (Already have)
  📸 keepers-heart-bottle.png      (Need - for success screen)
  📸 jameson-bottle-sample.png     (Optional - for testing ML)
  📸 background-texture.jpg        (Optional - wood grain)
  📸 flame-sprite.png             (Optional - better burn effect)
```

## 💡 Quick Wins

### 1. Use verify.png for Success Screen
Could add checkmark animation on success screen:

```tsx
// In /app/success/[sessionId]/page.tsx
<Image
  src="/images/verify.png"
  alt="Success"
  width={80}
  height={80}
  className="animate-bounce"
/>
```

### 2. Add Keeper's Heart Bottle Image
Replace the CSS gradient placeholder:

```tsx
// Current (placeholder):
<div className="w-48 h-64 mx-auto bg-gradient-to-b from-whiskey-amber to-copper rounded-lg shadow-xl" />

// With real image:
<Image
  src="/images/keepers-heart-bottle.png"
  alt="Keeper's Heart Whiskey"
  width={192}
  height={256}
  className="mx-auto"
/>
```
