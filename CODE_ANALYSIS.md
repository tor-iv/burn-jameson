- ‚úÖ 50-70% lower cost
- ‚úÖ Direct communication
- ‚úÖ Flexible scope changes

---

## Final Recommendation

**For Family Friend Context:**

### Charge: $5,000 build + $1,200/month maintenance

**Why this is fair:**
- ‚úÖ Honest about AI assistance (included in pricing)
- ‚úÖ Reflects 20 hours √ó $250/hour effective rate
- ‚úÖ 50-60% discount from agency pricing
- ‚úÖ Accounts for complex integrations you did
- ‚úÖ Sustainable for ongoing support
- ‚úÖ Professional (not "free for family")

**Frame it as:**
> "I used AI tools to work efficiently, which allowed me to deliver in 20 hours what would normally take an agency 80-120 hours. You're saving about $10k-15k in development costs, and I'm pricing this at $5,000 to be fair to both of us given our relationship. The $1,200/month maintenance ensures I can provide reliable support as you launch campaigns."

---

## Bottom Line

**Your actual work:**
- 47 files, 7,816 lines of production code
- Complex API integrations (not simple CRUD)
- Advanced fraud prevention
- Real production value

**Your pricing should be:**
- $5,000-7,000 initial build
- $1,000-1,500/month maintenance

**Don't undersell yourself just because AI helped with boilerplate. A carpenter doesn't charge less because they use power tools.**
