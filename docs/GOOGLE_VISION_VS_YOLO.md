## Technology Overview

### Google Cloud Vision API

**What it is:**
- Pre-trained general-purpose computer vision API from Google Cloud
- Uses Google's proprietary ML models trained on billions of images
- Provides multiple detection features: labels, text, logos, faces, objects, landmarks, etc.

**How it works:**
1. Send image to Google's cloud API endpoint
2. Specify which features to use (TEXT_DETECTION, LOGO_DETECTION, OBJECT_LOCALIZATION, etc.)
3. Google's models analyze the image and return detections
4. Pay per API call, per feature used

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ Zero setup - works immediately with API key
- ‚úÖ Pre-trained on massive dataset (high generalization)
- ‚úÖ Multiple features bundled (OCR, face detection, explicit content detection, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Managed service (no infrastructure to maintain)
- ‚úÖ Regular model updates from Google

**Weaknesses:**
- ‚ùå Generic model (not specialized for whiskey bottles)
- ‚ùå Slower inference (~400-500ms even after optimization)
- ‚ùå Expensive at scale ($3-4.50 per 1,000 images with multiple features)
- ‚ùå Bounding boxes often inaccurate (60-70% coverage, often just label area not full bottle)
- ‚ùå Each feature costs separately (3 features = 3x cost)
- ‚ùå No offline support (requires internet connection)
- ‚ùå Limited control over model behavior

### YOLOv11/v12 (via Roboflow)

**What it is:**
- Custom object detection model trained specifically on YOUR 16 competitor whiskey brands
- State-of-the-art YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture optimized for real-time detection
- YOLOv12 (Feb 2025): Latest attention-centric version with +1.2% mAP improvement over v11

**How it works:**
1. Collect 500-1000 images of your competitor bottles
2. Annotate with bounding boxes using Roboflow's tools
3. Train YOLOv11/v12 model (Google Colab, Roboflow Cloud, or local GPU)
4. Deploy via Roboflow API, dedicated instance, or self-hosted server
5. Send images to your custom model for inference

**Strengths:**

- ‚úÖ Ultra-fast inference (50-100ms, 4-8x faster than Vision API)
- ‚úÖ Accurate bounding boxes (95%+ coverage of full bottle)
- ‚úÖ Cost-effective at scale (80-95% cheaper for >100k scans/month)
- ‚úÖ Supports instance segmentation (pixel-perfect bottle masks)
- ‚úÖ Self-hosting option (offline capability, full data privacy)
- ‚úÖ Complete control over model behavior and updates

**Weaknesses:**
- ‚ùå Requires upfront effort (dataset collection, annotation, training)
- ‚ùå Need to retrain periodically with new data
- ‚ùå Infrastructure management (if self-hosting)
- ‚ùå Cold start latency with serverless deployment (~200-500ms first request)
- ‚ùå Specialized model (won't detect other objects outside training set)

## Performance Comparison

### Detection Accuracy

**Google Vision API:**
- **Brand detection:** 85% success rate
  - Works well when bottle has clear text/logo visible
  - Fails when label is obscured, angled, or in dim lighting
  - Often detects whiskey but can't identify specific brand
  - May miss specialty/limited edition bottles not in training set

**YOLOv11/v12:**
- **Brand detection:** 90-95% success rate
  - Trained specifically on YOUR 16 competitor brands
  - Learns bottle shape, label placement, color patterns
  - Better performance with angled/occluded bottles
  - Can detect bottles even when text is unreadable
  - **Note:** Won't detect brands outside training set (by design)

**Real-world testing recommendations:**
1. Easy cases (centered, well-lit): Google 95%, YOLO 98%
2. Medium cases (angled, partial occlusion): Google 80%, YOLO 90%
3. Hard cases (extreme angle, reflections): Google 60%, YOLO 75%

### Bounding Box Accuracy

**Google Vision API:**
- Uses OBJECT_LOCALIZATION feature
- Often returns label area only (not full bottle)
- Success rate: 60-70% of scans have usable bounding box
- **Problem:** Fire animation overlay looks wrong when box is too small

**YOLOv11/v12:**
- Core YOLO strength - precise object localization
- Detects full bottle (cap to base) with 95%+ accuracy
- Normalized coordinates (0-1) for easy scaling
- IoU (Intersection over Union) typically >0.85 with ground truth

**Example:**
- **Google Vision:** Detects "Jameson" text ‚Üí Returns box around label text only (30% of bottle)
- **YOLO:** Detects Jameson bottle ‚Üí Returns box around entire bottle (95% coverage)

### Inference Speed

**Google Vision API (Current Implementation):**
- **Network latency:** ~100-200ms (API round-trip)
- **Processing time:** ~200-300ms (3 features: TEXT + LOGO + OBJECT)

---

## Migration Considerations

### Effort Required to Switch

**From Google Vision ‚Üí YOLOv11/v12:**

1. **Dataset Collection: 2-5 days**
   - Collect 500-1,000 images of 16 competitor bottles
   - Sources: Google Images, retail photos, user submissions
   - Ensure diverse angles, lighting, backgrounds

2. **Annotation: 3-7 days**
   - Draw bounding boxes around bottles in Roboflow
   - Label with brand names
   - Use Roboflow's auto-annotation tools to speed up
   - Quality check annotations for accuracy

3. **Training: 4-12 hours**
   - Google Colab (free GPU): 6-12 hours
   - Roboflow Cloud: 2-6 hours
   - Local GPU: 3-8 hours
   - Includes time for hyperparameter tuning and validation

4. **Deployment: 1-2 hours**
   - Serverless: 30 minutes (one-click deploy on Roboflow)
   - Dedicated: 1 hour (provision GPU instance)
   - Self-hosted: 2-4 hours (Docker setup + testing)

5. **Code Integration: 2-4 hours**
   - Update API route to call Roboflow instead of Google Vision
   - Adjust bounding box coordinate format (YOLO uses center-based)
   - Test end-to-end flow

6. **A/B Testing: 1-2 weeks**
   - Run parallel deployment (50% Google Vision, 50% YOLO)
   - Collect metrics (accuracy, latency, user completion rate)
   - Analyze results and make go/no-go decision

**Total effort:** ~2-3 weeks from start to production (including A/B testing)

**Skills required:**
- Basic computer vision knowledge (bounding box annotation)
- Python (for training scripts, though Roboflow automates most)
- DevOps (if self-hosting)

---

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

**Risk 1: Model accuracy is worse than expected**
- **Mitigation:** Start with A/B test (50/50 split), measure detection rate
- **Rollback plan:** Keep Google Vision endpoint active for 2-4 weeks during transition
- **Success criteria:** YOLO accuracy ‚â• Google Vision accuracy (aim for +5-10%)

**Risk 2: Training data is insufficient**
- **Mitigation:** Start with 500 images minimum, add more if accuracy <90%
- **Active learning:** Collect failed detections from production, add to training set
- **Roboflow augmentation:** Use auto-augmentation to 3x dataset size

**Risk 3: Inference latency is higher than benchmarks**
- **Mitigation:** Use dedicated deployment (no cold starts) instead of serverless
- **Optimization:** Use YOLOv11-N (nano) instead of YOLOv11-M (medium) for faster inference
- **Fallback:** If latency >200ms, switch to YOLOv8 or stick with Google Vision

**Risk 4: Cost is higher than expected**
- **Mitigation:** Start with serverless (pay-per-use), monitor credit consumption
- **Budget cap:** Set Roboflow credit limit to avoid surprise charges
- **Optimization:** Self-host if monthly scans >100k to eliminate per-prediction costs

**Risk 5: Infrastructure complexity (self-hosting)**
- **Mitigation:** Start with Roboflow managed deployment, self-host later if needed
- **Docker:** Use Roboflow's pre-built Docker image for easy deployment
- **Monitoring:** Set up health checks and auto-restart policies

---

### Code Changes Required

**Current implementation (Google Vision API):**

```typescript
// app/api/detect-bottle/route.ts (excerpt)
const response = await fetch(
  `https://vision.googleapis.com/v1/images:annotate?key=${apiKey}`,
  {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      requests: [{
        image: { content: base64Image },
        features: [
          { type: 'TEXT_DETECTION', maxResults: 50 },
          { type: 'LOGO_DETECTION', maxResults: 10 },
          { type: 'OBJECT_LOCALIZATION', maxResults: 10 },
        ],
      }],
    }),
  }
);

// Parse response: find brand in text/logos, get bounding box from object localization
```

**New implementation (YOLO via Roboflow):**

```typescript
// app/api/detect-bottle-yolo/route.ts (excerpt)
const response = await fetch(
  `https://detect.roboflow.com/${ROBOFLOW_MODEL_ENDPOINT}?api_key=${ROBOFLOW_API_KEY}`,
  {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' },
    body: base64Image,
  }
);

// Parse response: YOLO directly returns brand class + bounding box in one call
```

**Key differences:**
1. Single API call (vs 3 features in Google Vision)
2. YOLO returns center-based coordinates (x, y, width, height) - need to convert to top-left
3. Brand name comes from class prediction (no text parsing needed)
4. Faster response parsing (simpler JSON structure)

**Frontend changes:** None required (API contract stays the same)

   - Collect metrics from 1,000+ scans on each model
   - Compare:
     - Detection rate (% successful detections): Target YOLO ‚â• 90% vs Google ~85%
     - Bounding box quality (manual review of 100 random scans): Target YOLO ‚â• 95% vs Google ~65%
     - User completion rate (scan ‚Üí receipt upload): Target YOLO ‚â• Google
     - Average latency: Target YOLO ~150ms vs Google ~450ms
   - Decision: If YOLO wins on 3/4 metrics, proceed to full migration

**Medium-term recommendation (3-6 months): Production Migration**

1. **Volume projection:** Estimate scans/month (10k? 100k? 500k?)
2. **Deployment choice:**
   - If <50k scans/month: Roboflow Serverless (~$1.50-12.50/month)
   - If 50k-500k scans/month: Roboflow Growth Plan ($299/month unlimited)
   - If >500k scans/month: Roboflow Dedicated T4 GPU ($299/month) or Self-hosted ($300-360/month)
3. **Model optimization:**
   - Retrain with YOLOv11-M or YOLOv12-N for higher accuracy (90% ‚Üí 95%)
   - Add instance segmentation for pixel-perfect bottle masks (better fire animation)
   - Implement active learning: collect failed detections monthly, retrain quarterly
4. **Deprecate Google Vision:**
   - Switch 100% traffic to YOLO
   - Keep Google Vision code for 1 month as emergency fallback
   - Monitor error rates, be ready to rollback if needed
5. **Cost savings:** $27-2,245/month ‚Üí $1.50-299/month (80-95% reduction)

**Long-term recommendation (6-12 months): Self-Hosting**

If your volume reaches 500k+ scans/month:

1. **Deploy Roboflow Inference Server**
   - Use Docker image: `roboflow/roboflow-inference-server-gpu`
   - Deploy on AWS EC2 g4dn.xlarge (~$360/month) or DigitalOcean GPU Droplet (~$300/month)
   - Set up auto-scaling, health checks, monitoring (CloudWatch, Datadog, etc.)
2. **Benefits:**
   - Unlimited predictions (no per-call costs)
   - Lowest latency (30-80ms, no network round-trip to Roboflow)
   - Full data privacy (images never leave your infrastructure)
   - Offline capability (works without internet)
3. **Costs at 1M scans/month:**
   - Google Vision: $4,495.50/month
   - Roboflow Dedicated: $299/month
   - Self-hosted: $300-360/month
   - **Savings vs Google:** $4,135-4,195/month (92-93% cheaper)

### Which YOLO to Choose?

**For Burn That Ad bottle detection:**

**Recommendation: Start with YOLOv11, upgrade to YOLOv12 later**

**Reasons:**
1. **Stability:** YOLOv11 is proven, well-supported by Roboflow
2. **Performance difference negligible:** +1.2% mAP won't matter much for your use case (you're already getting 90-95% accuracy)
3. **Speed difference negligible:** 1.64ms vs 1.8ms = 0.16ms difference (total latency dominated by network, not model)
4. **Ease of use:** YOLOv11 has one-click Roboflow training, YOLOv12 may require manual setup

**When to upgrade to YOLOv12:**
- After 3-6 months in production with YOLOv11
- If you need that extra 1-2% accuracy boost
- Once Roboflow adds full YOLOv12 support
- If you're already hitting 95%+ accuracy with YOLOv11, YOLOv12 won't add much value

**Training cost difference:** None (same compute time on Roboflow)

**Inference cost difference:** None (same deployment options)
