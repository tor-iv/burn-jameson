# Burn That Ad - Project Requirements

**Priority Source:** [patrick-planning.md](outline-docs/patrick-planning.md)
**Campaign:** Keeper's Heart Whiskey AR Marketing Campaign

---

## Executive Summary

Build a bar/distributor-agnostic PWA microsite that uses WebAR and computer vision to let consumers "burn" competitor whiskey ads (Jameson/Paddy's), unlock Keeper's Heart discounts, upload receipts, and receive direct cash rebates‚Äîwith zero friction for bars or distributors.

---

## Core User Flow

1. **Entry Point**
   - Consumer scans QR code (table tents, coasters, digital ads) OR accesses microsite directly via geofenced mobile ads (Instagram, TikTok, Google Maps)

2. **Age Gate**
   - Modal overlay: "Are you 21+?" with YES/NO buttons
   - Must pass age verification before accessing app

3. **AR Recognition**
   - Phone camera uses AR/OCR to detect "Jameson" or "Paddy's" on menu items (no QR code needed on the target)
   - Alternative: Direct QR trigger if simpler

4. **AR Burn Effect**
   - Competitor menu item "burns" with AR overlay animation
   - Keeper's Heart offer/discount code appears on screen

5. **Purchase & Receipt Upload**
   - Consumer buys Keeper's Heart whiskey at bar
   - Uploads receipt photo via app (OCR processes it)

6. **Direct Payout**
   - Consumer receives rebate via Venmo, PayPal, Zelle, prepaid Visa, or gift card
   - **No bar or distributor involvement in promo redemption**

- **Framework:** React (PWA/microsite)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Animations:** Framer Motion
- **Camera Access:** WebRTC/getUserMedia API

### AR & Computer Vision
- **WebAR Options:**
  - 8thWall (commercial, robust)
  - MindAR (open-source)
  - AR.js (lightweight, open-source)
  - three.js for 3D burn effects

- **OCR Options:**
  - **Web-based:** Tesseract.js (in-browser OCR)
  - **Native:** ML Kit Text Recognition (if building native modules)
  - **Cloud:** Google Document AI, Tabscanner, Veryfi

### Backend Stack
- **API:** Node.js + Express (or Next.js API routes)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (via Supabase or Railway)
- **Session Management:** JWT or session tokens (Supabase Auth if using Supabase)
- **File Storage:** Supabase Storage, Railway volumes, or Cloudflare R2 (for receipt images)

### Receipt Processing
- **Vendors:** Tabscanner, Veryfi, Google Document AI
- **Validation Logic:**
  - Verify "Keeper's Heart" purchase
  - Validate date/time (within campaign window)
  - Check location (geofencing if required)
  - Amount verification (minimum purchase)

### Payment Rails
- **Options:**
  - Tremendous API (prepaid Visa cards, gift cards)
  - PayPal Payouts API
  - Venmo (manual or API if available)
  - Zelle (manual coordination)

### Analytics & Fraud Prevention
- **Analytics:** Segment, Amplitude, Mixpanel
- **Tracking Metrics:**
  - AR scans/activations
  - Receipt uploads
  - Successful redemptions
  - Viral sharing (social posts)
  - Cost per acquisition (CPA)
  - Fraud rate

### Anti-Abuse Measures
- **Age Gating:** 21+ verification required
- **Device Verification:** Fingerprinting (IP, device ID, browser signature)
- **Rate Limiting:** One redemption per user per X days (7-30 days)
- **Geofencing:** Limit to specific regions/states if needed
- **Duplicate Prevention:** Check phone number, email, receipt hash
- **Manual Review:** Flag suspicious patterns (same receipt, rapid submissions)

## Campaign Creative Concepts

### Primary: "Burn to Earn"
- AR burn effect on competitor menu item
- Instant Keeper's Heart reward reveal
- Direct cash rebate for purchase

### Alternative Hooks:
- **"Light It Up":** Fire-themed AR transformation
- **"Flip the Script":** Shake phone to flip competitor to Keeper's Heart
- **"Trade Up":** AR replacement of competitor drink
- **"Heart Beats Fire":** Competitor melts, Keeper's Heart rises

### UGC/Social Components:
- Share burn effect on Instagram/TikTok
- Contest entry for sharing
- Leaderboards (most burns, most referrals)
- Gamified sweepstakes

---

## Legal & Compliance

### Required Guardrails:
- **Comparative Advertising:** Must be truthful, not misleading
- **Tied-House Laws:** No unlawful inducements to bars (why we go direct-to-consumer)
- **AMOE (Sweepstakes):** Alternative Method of Entry for states requiring it
- **Privacy:** GDPR/CCPA-compliant data handling
- **Terms & Conditions:** Clear rules, eligibility, limitations
- **Official Rules:** For any contest/sweepstakes components

### Age Verification:
- 21+ gate required at entry
- Store verification timestamp
- Potentially integrate 3rd-party age verification (ID.me, Yoti)

### Geographic Restrictions:
- May need to exclude certain states (alcohol laws vary)
- Geofencing to verify user location

## Vendor Stack Recommendations

| Component | Recommended Option | Alternative |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| **WebAR** | MindAR (open-source) | 8thWall (commercial) |
| **OCR (Web)** | Tesseract.js | Google Document AI |
| **OCR (Cloud)** | Tabscanner API | Veryfi API |
| **Payments** | Tremendous API | PayPal Payouts |
| **Analytics** | Segment + Amplitude | Mixpanel |
| **Hosting** | Vercel (frontend + API) | Railway (fullstack) or Supabase (BaaS) |
| **Database** | Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage) | Railway PostgreSQL or Neon |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Map exact vendor stack** (OCR/AR/payment/verification providers)
2. **Develop open-source POC** (React PWA with camera + mock burn effect)
3. **Draft creative assets** (logo animations, AR effects, social templates)
4. **Legal documentation** (terms, privacy policy, official rules, AMOE)
5. **Pilot partner selection** (identify 10-20 bars for initial launch)
6. **Marketing plan** (digital ads, street teams, influencer outreach)

---

## MVP Decisions (Phase 1)

### ‚úÖ Confirmed Decisions:
- **Camera:** Real camera access with WebRTC/getUserMedia
- **AR Approach:** Start with QR code trigger, but architect for future text detection
- **Payment:** Venmo integration first (PayPal/Tremendous later)
- **Age Gate:** Simple "Yes/No" with localStorage (already implemented in [age-gate.tsx](age-gate.tsx))
- **Exit Action:** Redirect to responsibility.org (educational content)
- **Brand Assets:** Keeper's Heart logo available in [images/logo.png](images/logo.png)
- **Framework:** Next.js (based on existing age-gate.tsx)
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage)

### üîÑ Still To Decide:
- [ ] Coupon codes: Real/unique generation or static for MVP?
- [ ] Receipt upload: Required for rebate or optional?
- [ ] OCR provider: Tesseract.js (free, in-browser) vs. cloud API?
- [ ] Geofencing: National or regional pilot?
- [ ] Contest/sweepstakes component in MVP?
