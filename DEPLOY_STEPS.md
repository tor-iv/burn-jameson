# Deploy to Vercel - Step by Step

## âœ… Vercel CLI Installed
Version: 48.2.9

---

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Login to Vercel
```bash
vercel login
```
This will:
- Open browser for authentication
- You can sign up with GitHub, GitLab, or email
- One-time setup

### 2. Deploy the Project
```bash
vercel
```

You'll be asked:
- **Set up and deploy?** â†’ Yes
- **Which scope?** â†’ Your account/team
- **Link to existing project?** â†’ No (first time)
- **Project name?** â†’ burn-jameson (or custom name)
- **Directory?** â†’ ./ (press Enter)
- **Override settings?** â†’ No (press Enter)

### 3. Wait for Deployment
Vercel will:
- âœ… Upload your code
- âœ… Install dependencies
- âœ… Build Next.js app
- âœ… Deploy to global CDN
- âœ… Give you a live URL

Expected time: **2-3 minutes**

### 4. Get Your Live URL
```
ðŸŽ‰ Deployed to production!
https://burn-jameson.vercel.app
```

## After First Deployment

### Future Deployments (Super Easy)
```bash
# Just run:
vercel

# Or for production:
vercel --prod
```

### Automatic Deployments (Even Easier)
Once deployed, Vercel will watch your GitHub repo:
- Every `git push` â†’ New preview deployment
- Push to `main/master` â†’ Production deployment

- View build logs in Vercel dashboard

### Q: How do I add environment variables?
**A:**
1. Go to vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select project â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables
3. Add variables (e.g., `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`)

### Q: Can I use a custom domain?
**A:**
1. Go to project Settings â†’ Domains
2. Add your domain (e.g., burnthatad.com)

## Next Steps After Deployment

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails?
```bash
# Test build locally first
npm run build

# If it works locally but fails on Vercel:
# - Check Node.js version (should be 18+)
# - Check for environment-specific code
# - View detailed logs in Vercel dashboard
```

### Want to Redeploy?
```bash
vercel --force
```

### Want to Delete Deployment?
```bash
# Go to vercel.com/dashboard
# Project â†’ Settings â†’ Delete Project
