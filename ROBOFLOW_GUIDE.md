# Roboflow Custom Model - Complete Guide

## What is Roboflow?

**Roboflow** is a platform that makes it easy to train custom computer vision models **without being an ML expert**.

Think of it like: **"Photoshop for AI training"**

### What You Get
- Web-based tool to upload and label images
- Automatic model training (no coding required)
- Deploy as API (just like Google Vision)
- Custom model that recognizes YOUR specific objects

---

## How It Works (Simple Explanation)

### 1. **Collect Photos** (Your job - 2 hours)
Take 100-500 photos of Jameson bottles:
- Different angles
- Different lighting
- Different backgrounds
- Different Jameson variants (Original, Black Barrel, etc.)

### 2. **Label Photos** (Your job - 2 hours)
Draw boxes around bottles in Roboflow's web interface:
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│                     │
│    ┌──────────┐     │
│    │ JAMESON  │     │ <- Draw box, label "Jameson"
│    │  Bottle  │     │
│    └──────────┘     │
│                     │
└─────────────────────┘
```

### 3. **Train Model** (Roboflow does this - 30 min automatic)
Roboflow takes your labeled images and trains a YOLOv8 neural network:
- Learns what Jameson bottles look like
- Learns to ignore other objects
- Creates a model file

### 4. **Deploy as API** (Roboflow hosts it - 5 min)
You get an API endpoint:
```typescript
const response = await fetch('https://detect.roboflow.com/your-model/1', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: imageFile,
  headers: { 'api_key': 'your-key' }
});

// Returns: { "predictions": [{ "class": "jameson", "confidence": 0.94 }] }
```

## Why Roboflow for Bottle Detection?

### Problem with Google Vision
Google Vision is trained on **millions of general images**:
- ✅ Knows: "bottle", "whiskey", "drink"
- ❌ Doesn't know: "Jameson" vs "Tullamore Dew"
- ❌ Can't tell brands apart

### Solution with Roboflow
You train a model **specifically for whiskey bottles**:
- ✅ Knows: "Jameson Original", "Jameson Black Barrel"
- ✅ Knows: "Tullamore Dew", "Bushmills"
- ✅ Can distinguish brands even at angles

---

## Step-by-Step Tutorial

### Step 1: Create Roboflow Account
```bash
# Go to: https://roboflow.com
# Sign up (free tier: 1,000 API calls/month)
# Click "Create New Project"
```

**Project Settings:**
- Name: `irish-whiskey-detector`
- Type: **Object Detection**
- Annotation Group: `Whiskey Bottles`

### Step 2: Collect Training Images

**What you need:**
```
Jameson Original:     100 photos (most important)
Jameson Black Barrel:  50 photos
Tullamore Dew:         50 photos (to teach difference)
Bushmills:             50 photos (to teach difference)
Proper Twelve:         30 photos (optional)
Negative examples:     50 photos (bourbon, scotch, vodka)
```

**How to collect:**
```bash
# Option A: Take your own photos
# - Visit liquor stores
# - Take photos with phone (various angles)
# - Different lighting conditions
# - Different backgrounds

# Option B: Web scraping (be careful of copyright)
# - Google Images (use with caution)
# - Product websites
# - User-generated content (with permission)

# Option C: Use existing dataset
# - Open Images Dataset (search "whiskey bottle")
# - Roboflow Universe (public datasets)
```

**Pro Tips:**
- 📸 Variety is key (angles, lighting, backgrounds)
- 📸 Include partial views (not just perfect shots)
- 📸 Include reflections, shadows, blur (real-world conditions)
- 📸 Take 3x more photos than you think you need

### Step 3: Upload & Annotate Images

**Upload to Roboflow:**
```bash
# 1. Click "Upload" in Roboflow dashboard
# 2. Drag and drop your 300+ images
# 3. Wait for upload (5-10 minutes)
```

**Annotate (Draw Boxes):**
```
For each image:
1. Click image to open
2. Press "B" for box tool
3. Draw box around bottle
4. Type class name: "jameson_original"
5. Press Enter
6. Repeat for all images

Keyboard shortcuts:
- B = Box tool
- V = Select tool
- Delete = Remove box
- Ctrl+Z = Undo
```

**Class Names (be consistent!):**
```
jameson_original
jameson_black_barrel
jameson_caskmates
tullamore_dew
bushmills_original
proper_twelve
other_whiskey
```

**Time estimate:**
- 300 images × 30 seconds each = 2.5 hours
- Use Roboflow's **Smart Polygon** to speed up (1 click labeling)

### Step 4: Generate Dataset

**In Roboflow:**
```bash
# 1. Click "Generate" → "Generate New Version"
# 2. Choose preprocessing steps:
#    ✅ Auto-Orient (fix rotation)
#    ✅ Resize: 640x640 (standard for YOLOv8)
#    ✅ Auto-Contrast (improve visibility)
# 3. Choose augmentation (optional for more data):
#    ✅ Flip: Horizontal
#    ✅ Rotate: ±15°
#    ✅ Brightness: ±20%
#    ✅ Blur: Up to 1px
# 4. Click "Generate"
```

**What happens:**
- Roboflow creates train/validation/test splits (70/20/10)
- Applies preprocessing to all images
- Creates augmented versions (2x-3x more data)
- Final dataset: ~1,000 images from 300 originals

### Step 5: Train Model

**In Roboflow:**
```bash
# 1. Click "Train" → "Train Model"
# 2. Choose model:
#    → YOLOv8 (recommended - fast & accurate)
#    → YOLOv5 (alternative)
#    → EfficientDet (slower but more accurate)
# 3. Choose training duration:
#    → Fast Train: 1 hour (good for MVP)
#    → Standard: 4 hours (better accuracy)
#    → Longer: 12+ hours (best accuracy)
# 4. Click "Start Training"
```

**What happens (automatic):**
- Roboflow spins up GPU servers
- Trains YOLOv8 model on your data
- Tests accuracy on validation set
- Saves best model checkpoint

**Training metrics you'll see:**
```
Epoch 1/100: Loss: 0.85, mAP: 0.45
Epoch 50/100: Loss: 0.32, mAP: 0.78
Epoch 100/100: Loss: 0.18, mAP: 0.91 ✅

Final Metrics:
- Precision: 92%
- Recall: 89%
- mAP@0.5: 91%
```

**What these mean:**
- **Precision:** When model says "Jameson", it's right 92% of the time
- **Recall:** Finds 89% of Jameson bottles in images
- **mAP:** Overall accuracy score (91% is excellent)

### Step 6: Test Model

**In Roboflow Dashboard:**
```bash
# 1. Go to "Deploy" → "Test & Use"
# 2. Upload test image (new Jameson photo)
# 3. See predictions:

┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│                                 │
│    ┌──────────────────┐         │
│    │ jameson_original │ 94%     │
│    │                  │         │
│    └──────────────────┘         │
│                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────┘

Predictions:
- Class: jameson_original
- Confidence: 0.94
- Bounding box: [x: 120, y: 80, w: 200, h: 350]
```

**Test with various scenarios:**
- ✅ Front label (expect: >90% confidence)
- ✅ Angled bottle (expect: >80% confidence)
- ✅ Poor lighting (expect: >70% confidence)
- ✅ Tullamore Dew (expect: Correctly identifies as different brand)

### Step 7: Deploy API

**Get API credentials:**
```bash
# In Roboflow:
# 1. Go to "Deploy" → "API"
# 2. Copy API key
# 3. Copy model URL

API_KEY=abc123xyz
MODEL_URL=https://detect.roboflow.com/irish-whiskey-detector/1
```

**Integrate into your app:**

```typescript
// lib/bottle-detection-roboflow.ts
export async function detectBottleRoboflow(imageBlob: Blob): Promise<DetectionResult> {
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('file', imageBlob);

  const response = await fetch(
    `https://detect.roboflow.com/${process.env.ROBOFLOW_MODEL}/1?api_key=${process.env.ROBOFLOW_API_KEY}`,
    {
      method: 'POST',
      body: formData,
    }
  );

  const data = await response.json();

  // Roboflow returns predictions array
  const predictions = data.predictions || [];

  // Find highest confidence prediction
  const best = predictions.reduce((max: any, p: any) =>
    p.confidence > (max?.confidence || 0) ? p : max,
    null
  );

  if (!best) {
    return { detected: false, brand: 'Unknown', confidence: 0 };
  }

  return {
    detected: best.confidence > 0.75,
    brand: best.class.replace('_', ' '), // "jameson_original" → "Jameson Original"
    confidence: best.confidence,
    boundingBox: {
      x: best.x,
      y: best.y,
      width: best.width,
      height: best.height,
    },
  };
}
```

**Update your detection API:**

```typescript
// app/api/detect-bottle/route.ts
import { detectBottleRoboflow } from '@/lib/bottle-detection-roboflow';

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const formData = await request.formData();
  const image = formData.get('image') as Blob;

  const result = await detectBottleRoboflow(image);

  return NextResponse.json(result);
}
```
